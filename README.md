# Convex-Optimization-SIGMA
This project is the lab works of convex optimization course at Master 2 SIGMA program at Grenoble INP.
There are 2 lab works that are in progress of fullflling. The first lab work is about Portfolio optimization. The method that has been implemented in this lab is unconstrained method. Graduient Descent. Barrier Method. The function for minimization is $w^Tcw$. C is covariance of the stock dataset. Each dataset are presented in the folder.
